Old example strategies
======================

This section contains old example algorithmic trading strategies.
These were written for :term:`Backtrader` and :term:`QSTrader` backtesting engines.
However, they have been phased oun in the favour of our internal `tradeexecutor` engine.
The examples are here for a historical reference and might not run.
