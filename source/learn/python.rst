 Python for Kids brings Python to life and brings kids (and their parents) into the wonderful world of programming. Author Jason R. Briggs guides readers through the basics, experimenting with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is coloured, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-colour illustrations keep things fun and engaging throughout.
